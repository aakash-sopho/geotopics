BACK-END

FRONT-END

* For some reason the map always centers where it wants to,
	cannot pull it elsewhere, and it is not always well centered
	edit: it gets movable after zooming, maybe that's ok
* keep only some of the cities
* expand about page
* add footer

DONE * figure out what's wrong with new york and other cities
DONE * Remove fullscreen by default, at least for the demo? :)
DONE * add more features for individual values -- just add manually some by default
DONE * add dayOfWeek stats
DONE * remove maps for distinctive values, keep only for likely (the information is not differrent)
		> actually we are just generating joint probability plots for the ones that are more distincive at some place	
DONE * keep only 5-6 regions by default
DONE * for time of day and day of week, the set of values should be fixed
DONE * add 'about' page
	-- names
	-- short description
	-- other credits (tools and funding)
DONE * make heatmaps align with map -- SOLUTION: re-compute the city bounds
DONE * make interface a little nicer
-- for time of day and day of week, the _order_ of values should be fixed
-- make region plot text (bar values) smaller
-- put selection menus in different lines
-- make plots a little shorter
