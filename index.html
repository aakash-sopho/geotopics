          Overview
        </h1>
        <p>
          GeoTopics is a system to explore geographical 
          patterns of urban activity. The system collects publicly 
          shared check-ins generated by Foursquare 
          users, that reveal who spends time where, when, and on what 
          type of activity. It then employs sparse 
          probabilistic modeling techniques to learn associations 
          between different regions of a city and multi-feature descriptions 
          of urban activity. Users of the system 
          select a city of interest and explore visualizations that 
          highlight how different types of activity are spatially and 
          temporally distributed in the city.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Architecture
        </h1>
        <p>
        The architecture of the system is shown in the figure below. As shown 
        there, it consists of three modules, namely data collection,
        analysis, and the front-end.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Data collection </h2>
        <p>The two main tasks of this module are to (i) filter the Twitter
          gardenhose sample to look for publicly shared check-ins, and
          (ii) subsequently query Foursquare in order to obtain data associated
          with each check-in. The module also performs data-cleaning and
          filtering tasks. Its output is a database of venues and their
          associated activity for a period of time.
        </p>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The two main tasks of this module are to (i) fit a model on the data
          for each city, and (ii) process the resulting models and produce
          the maps used for exploration by the next module.
          Model training takes a few hours on 8 cores using the numpy Python
          library for data acquired over the period of one month.
        </p>
        <h2>Front-end</h2>
        <p>
          The system provides a user interface to enable the exploration of
          analysis results. The user is able to select a city of interest
          and explore the analysis results produced for that city by the two
          previous modules.

        <div id="demo">
        <h1> Demo </h1>
        <p>
          Try our <a href="http://mmathioudakis.github.io/geotopics/demo.html">demo</a>
          for <a href="http://www2016.ca/">WWW2016</a>.

          The demo offers the following functionality.
        </p>
        <h2>Regional decomposition</h2>
        <p>
         The user selects one city to obtain a decomposition of the city into a
         small number of regions, each associated with a description of
         activity.
         The description is provided in the form of relative frequencies,
         that describe how often different types of activity appear in that
         region (e.g., ‘15% of activity appears at restaurants’) and
         how more often compared to the entire city (e.g., ‘2 times more
         frequently than the rest of the city’).
        </p>
        <h2>Likely and distinctive feature values</h2>
        <p>
          The user selects one feature of the data, e.g., the category of
          venues or the time of the day of check-ins, and obtains heatmaps of
          two types: one that shows which feature value is most <u>likely</u>
          (i.e. <i>frequent</i>) at
          each point in the city; and one that shows which feature value is
          most <u>distinctive</u> at each point in the city (in the sense that 
          it appears much more frequently than in the rest of the city). For
          example, by inspecting the heatmaps, one might discover that
          restaurants is the most common category type near Times Square in
          Manhattan, and theaters is the most distinctive category type for
          the same area.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Geographic distribution of feature values
        </h2>
        <p>
          Finally, the user picks one value for the feature selected in the
          previous step (e.g., value ‘restaurant’ for feature venue category,
          or value ‘morning’ for feature check-in time of the day). The system
          then provides a distribution of activity associated with the selected
          feature value across the city.
